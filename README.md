# LearningPython
Here I post my first python projects. 
I am learning how to use this programming Language I come from a C and Java environment 

## Guessing Game
Is the first small project I made. 
It's just a small number guessing game where you have to guess a number between 1 and 100

## Sudoku Solver
This is a simple program that solves a sudoku you can pass as argument to the function read_file(file) be aware that empty spaces are filled with a 0. 
The algorithm used is just a simple recursive brute force algorithm that looks for all possible solutions even tho usually a sudoku has one only solution
